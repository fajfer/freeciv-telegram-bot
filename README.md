# freeciv-telegram-bot

This is just a poor excuse for what the bot should be, for now it is 'just working'. I might consider developing it further as I use the bot more and there'll be more people wanting to use it.

### Quick docker job
`docker build -t fajfer/freeciv-telegram-bot:latest .` \
`docker run -d fajfer/freeciv-telegram-bot`
